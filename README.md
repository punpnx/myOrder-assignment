# Front-end Assignment
This code is based on the original source from https://citw01.pages.dev/ and was created for testing purposes as part of the interview process with Myorder Intelligence Co., Ltd.

## Set 1: Selected Tasks â€“ PIN, Chat, and Instagram Story
I chose to complete the **PIN** and **Chat** tasks because I believe they are more relevant and potentially applicable within the **myOrder** platform.  

For the third task, I chose **Instagram Story** over **Instagram Post** because it was simpler, faster to implement, and still allowed me to demonstrate layout and positioning skills. 

**Instagram Post** involved more complex UI elements and took longer than 30 minutes to complete, so I decided not to include it.

## Set 2: Selected Tasks â€“ Pastel Collage, Game Bracket, and Checkboard
In this set, I selected tasks that I could reasonably complete within the 45-minute time limit.  

I chose **Pastel Collage**, **Game Bracket**, and **Checkboard** and excluded **Control Room** and **Numpad** due to their complexity and the probability that they would exceed the time constraint.

## Skills Demonstrated
I aimed to cover a wide range of skills through these tasks, such as:

- **Flexbox Layout**
- **Absolute and Relative Positioning**
- **Transformations**
- **Gradients**
- **Shadows**

## Tools & Project Structure

- **Tailwind CSS v4.1** was used for styling.
- **Visual Studio Code** was the primary code editor.
- Each task folder includes:
  - `index.html`
  - A screenshot of the result
  - A `src` subfolder containing `input.css` for styling

Extra tasks I attempted in addition to the selected ones are stored in the **`others`** folder.
